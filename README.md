This is a program designed to help make decisions.

You've no doubt heard of a "pros and cons list", or the "yellow legal pad" system from How I Met Your Mother. It's essentially the idea that any decision can be made logically by listing out all the positive aspects and the negative aspects of a given decision. Any business people around you will likely call this a "cost-benefit analysis".

> Essentially, this is a purpose built excel spreadsheet.
